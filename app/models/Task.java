/*Each task has a generated id, a title, a flag to say whether it is done or not, a date that it must be completed by, a user 
it is assigned to, a folder and a project. The assignedTo and project relationships are mapped using @ManyToOne. This means a task may
 have one user, and one project, while each user may have many tasks assigned to them, and each project may have many tasks.

We also have a simple query, this time finding all the todo tasks, that is, those tasks that arenâ€™t done, assigned to a particular 
user, and a create method.*/
